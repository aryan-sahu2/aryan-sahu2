- 🛠 Built complete platform solo in 64 days — React, Node.js, Postgres, Express

💼 **Actively Looking for Opportunities**  
I'm currently seeking a **full-time role as a Full Stack Developer or Frontend Developer**. While I’ve been building my own startup (Kangagigs) from the ground up, my primary focus now is to join a company where I can learn, contribute, and grow as a developer. I intend to continue working on my startup on the side, but my full-time commitment and energy will be dedicated to my next role.
