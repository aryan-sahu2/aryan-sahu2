## 🚀 Introduction

Hello there! I'm Aryan, a tech enthusiast with a passion for continuous learning and building meaningful projects. Currently engaged in a technological profession, I've been working as an Applications Engineer at Newgen for almost a year.

In my current role, I work with a diverse tech stack, including Java, JavaScript, OracleSQL, and frontend technologies. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but has also provided valuable insights into the practical aspects of application development and integration.

## 💡 About Musqaan

In my journey, I've realized the significance of mental health, influenced by my experiences in sports and struggles with the education system. To contribute to the well-being of others, I founded Musqaan - a platform aimed at building a community of fashion designers, content writers, and volunteers. Although it didn't take off as a startup, I'm determined to revive and reshape the initiative. To learn more about Musqaan or to join hands, feel free to reach out to me at aryanwin0609@gmail.com.
